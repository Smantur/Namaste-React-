1.What is Emmet?
Emmet is a powerful toolkit for web developers that greatly enhances HTML and CSS workflow. It's integrated into various text editors, including Visual Studio Code (VSCode). In VSCode, Emmet provides shortcuts and abbreviations for writing HTML and CSS faster
For example, you can type ul>li*5 and then press the Tab key, and Emmet will expand it into:

2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
  Library:
        A library is a collection of pre-written code or routines that can be reused and imported into your own projects.
        Libraries typically consist of functions, classes, and modules that provide specific functionality, such as performing mathematical calculations, handling data structures, or interfacing with external systems.
        When using a library, developers have more control over the flow of their application. They can choose which parts of the library to use and how to integrate them into their code.
        Examples of libraries include NumPy for numerical computing in Python, jQuery for DOM manipulation in JavaScript, and Retrofit for making HTTP requests in Android development.

    Framework:
        A framework is a more comprehensive tool or structure that provides a foundation for building applications. It dictates the overall structure and flow of the application and often follows the "inversion of control" principle.
        Frameworks typically provide a skeleton architecture with predefined rules, conventions, and guidelines for building applications. Developers then fill in the details by writing code that fits within the framework's structure.
        Frameworks often include libraries and provide additional features such as templating engines, database abstraction layers, and authentication mechanisms.
        When using a framework, developers relinquish some control over the application's flow to the framework itself. They must adhere to the framework's conventions and structure.
        Examples of frameworks include Django and Flask for web development in Python, Angular and React for frontend development in JavaScript, and Spring for backend development in Java.
